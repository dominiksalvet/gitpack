The development of GitPack is published on [this website](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/gitpack) and **everyone is welcome to contribute**.

## Wrap GitPack Up

GitPack is simple. Compared to other package managers, it may be lacking some advanced features (such as dependency resolution). If you have the feeling that GitPack should have those features, you may create a GitPack wrapper with the desired features and call GitPack internally. This way, GitPack's flexibility will not be violated. Furthermore, foundations have already been laid to allow this kind of extension.

> GitPack API has come a long way and it is pretty stable now. But it [wasn't always](https://github.com/dominiksalvet/gim) like that.
