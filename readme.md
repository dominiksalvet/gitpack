> Simple Git-based package manager.

GitPack stands on a simple idea â€“ a Git repository is a package, its URL is the package name. Based on that it is possible to **install/update** your favorite Git projects as shown:

```
gitpack install <url>
```

And when they are no longer needed, **uninstall** them that way:

```
gitpack uninstall <url>
```

GitPack not only saves time for end users to figure out how to install a Git project, but it also **unifies the project development and distribution** in a convenient place; its Git repository.

> Do you want to try GitPack in your project? The [Developer](#developer) section will help you get started.

## Install

**Local** (user) installation:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominiksalvet/gitpack/master/.install/initl.sh | sh
```

**Global** (system) installation:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dominiksalvet/gitpack/master/.install/initg.sh | sh
```

> With the help of the mentioned scripts, **GitPack actually installs itself**. If you do not have `wget`, copy-paste the source code of one of the scripts into a shell terminal and execute it. That will work too.

Once installed, you will use GitPack to manage even itself (e.g., update).

### Dependencies

* **Git** software

## Usage

If GitPack is run with root permissions (e.g., using `sudo`), it will use global access and perform global installations. Otherwise, a local approach for the current user will be used.

Install/update to the **latest version**:

```
gitpack install <url>
```

Install/update/downgrade to a **particular version**:

```
gitpack install <url>=<version>
```

> The `<version>` is any Git revision (tag name, branch name, commit hash).

**Uninstall** (version is detected automatically):

```
gitpack uninstall <url>
```

**Show the status** of a project:

```
gitpack status <url>
```

**List all installed** projects:

```
gitpack list
```
