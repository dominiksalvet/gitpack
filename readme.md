> Simple Git-based package manager.

GitPack stands on a simple idea â€“ a Git repository is a package, its URL is the package name. Based on that it is possible to **install/update** your favorite Git projects as shown:

```
gitpack install <url>
```

And when they are no longer needed, **uninstall** them that way:

```
gitpack uninstall <url>
```

GitPack not only saves time for end users to figure out how to install a Git project, but it also **unifies the project development and distribution** in a convenient place; its Git repository.
