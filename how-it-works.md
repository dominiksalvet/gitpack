# Guide

This file contains **everything you need to start** using GitPack in your awesome projects. Once you have followed this guide, end users can immediately install, update or uninstall your projects. Immediately.

## General

In default, GitPack works with Git default branches using their either latest tag (preferred) or latest commit.

## Files

GitPack works with the `.gitpack` directory of Git repositories matching the following structure:

* `.gitpack/install/<method>` is a directory:
  * Its name starts with either `global` or `local` based on **installation type**.
  * To target a particular system, append its name as `-<system>`.
  * E.g., `global-Darwin` represents global installation for macOS.
* `.gitpack/install/<method>/map` is a file:
  * Describes how project files are copied/removed during **installation/uninstallation**.
  * Each nonempty line contains file paths to be copied and a target directory path.
  * Each nonempty line is evaluated as a shell function argument. Be careful.
  * E.g., line `bin/vhdldep ~/.local/bin` copies `vhdldep` file to `~/.local/bin` directory.

## Optional Files

GitPack also works with optional files located in the `.gitpack` directory as follows:

* `.gitpack/install/<method>/<script>` is an executable file:
  * Its name is `precp`, `postcp`, `prerm`, or `postrm`.
  * It is run before the copying, after, before the removal, or after.
  * E.g., `postcp` modifies `/etc/rc.local` file to run asus-fan-control after boot.
* `.gitpack/data` is a directory:
  * It contains any additional data related to the installation.
  * E.g., it contains `.bash_completion` file, which is copied during `precp` script execution.

## Environment Variables

GitPack provides the following environment variables to all called scripts:

* `OFFLINE_MODE`
  * Equals either `false` or `true`.
  * Once set to `true`, any online access should be avoided.

## Examples
